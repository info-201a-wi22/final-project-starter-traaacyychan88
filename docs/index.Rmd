### Abstract
Our main question is that how the change of carbon emission affect the economy. The question is significant because carbon emission is a serious concern around the world. To address the question will will collect the data of carbon emission and GDP growth and analyze them. In addition, we are using data visualization to present situation. 

Key words: Carbon foot print; Economy; GDP

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to investigate Carbon Emissions and how the Economy drives it. We want to see the different effects of how carbon emissions can affect our lives especially with global warming since it has become a bigger global concern. We want to explore this topic more indepthly through this project and hope to have a better understanding of how much carbon emissions different companies are emitting. Some of the companies have pledged to be carbon neutral thus, we will see some small and some significant changes in the data over the years. Along with this, different industries/companies emit different amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and we want to be able to make comparisons among the different industries.

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
