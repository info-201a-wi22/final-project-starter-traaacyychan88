### Abstract
Our main question is that how the change of carbon emission affect the economy. The question is significant because carbon emission is a serious concern around the world. To address the question will will collect the data of carbon emission and GDP growth and analyze them. In addition, we are using data visualization to present situation. 

Key words: Carbon foot print; Economy; GDP

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to investigate Carbon Emissions and how the Economy drives it. We want to see the different effects of how carbon emissions can affect our lives especially with global warming since it has become a bigger global concern. We want to explore this topic more indeptly through this project and hope to have a better understanding of how much carbon emissions different companies are emitting. Some of the companies have pledged to be carbon neutral thus, we will see some small and some significant changes in the data over the years. Along with this, different industries/companies emit different amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and we want to be able to make comparisons among the different industries.

### Design Situation
The topic for our project is how the change of carbon emission affect the economy. And what we did for our project is we collected the data of carbon emission and GDP growth to compare in order to analyze our main topic, for example, we will compare the carbon emission and GDP growth of same years to see if there are any connections. The direct stakeholders are the owner of some companies and governments, they will get some profits as they establish some policy to reduce the carbon emission and as the carbon emission goes down, and the indirect stakeholders are everyone that live in this world, because the environment get worse because of the carbon emission. Carbon emission is a serious problem right now, and it has always been a concern of the government and companies, because the problems caused by excessive carbon emission to atmosphere are vast and widespread. Moreover, large amount of carbon emission caused about 4.2 million premature deaths (according to World Health Organisation), ocean temperature to rise, food insecurity, and so on. The problems of carbon emission affect our lives a lot. However, one of the benefits of carbon emission decreasing is the GDP grows, the countries have carbon taxes, "carbon taxes are seen as a way to reduce emissions, while making the economy more efficient." Also, when the carbon emission decreased, the climate change would be greatly improved and can save large amount of money on global trade, because transport and distribution chains might become more vulnerable to disruptions due to climate change, which may cause a lot. Decreasing the carbon emission can brought profits to governments and companies, it can also give us a better environment to live. Also, there are some new techniques and invents to help reduce the carbon emission, which also save the costs of companies and some organizations, and brought more money to them, "According to the National Statistics, as a result of not only climate regulation and economic structural change, but also technological advancements that took place in the UK, the region was able to achieve decoupling between 1985 and 2016 with GDP per head rising by 70.7% while emissions dropped by 34%."

## Research Questions 
The questions are important in our project since we are trying to convey the importance of carbon emission in the air and the different amount of carbon emissions that everyone emits. 
The questions that we are going to address are listed here :
  What is the trend of CO2 emission from X date to X date?
  Are there any relationships between CO2 emission and economic activity?
  Which sector contributes the most carbon footprint?
  How can each individual firm contribute to the carbon footprint?
  How are each firm able to manage the release of carbon dioxide?
These questions are important because it helps us break down the data and have a better understanding of what factors contribute to the most carbon emissions in our atmosphere. For example we can look at how exactly the GDP drives CO2 emissions in different places. 
  

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
